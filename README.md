# n8n-test

Stands up n8n from a docker compose
assumes that the volume has already been created for the config

also sets the domain to be one I owm and have configured externally - this was to make some oauth callbacks work 

## Seems good

it uses lang chain under the hood.
seems quite good - but want to do more work with lang-chain directly before i start to use this as am unsure what compromises / assumptions / opportunities are being traded off
